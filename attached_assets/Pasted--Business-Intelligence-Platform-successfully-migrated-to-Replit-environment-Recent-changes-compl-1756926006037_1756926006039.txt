Understand the attached document and along with that fix my below concerns
the web scarpping is not working on am deploying on AWS EC2, make my webscrapping smoother and accurate it can be from India na dacross globe free web content , along with that undertand the attached document and make my code fully fucntional accurate and zero defects .There are two main.py make it one since its confusuing and please dont add unncessary code keep my existing working and please be very accuaret best mind .My system shouldnt hallucinate and its should be accurate

 DeepSeek offers free, open-source models that can be run locally for direct use with Python. These models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and its distilled versions, are available for download and can be integrated into Python projects for various tasks like reasoning, code generation, and problem-solving.
Here's how to use DeepSeek's free models directly with Python:
Download the Model:
DeepSeek models are typically available on platforms like Hugging Face. You'll need to download the specific model version that suits your hardware and needs (e.g., a 7B parameter model for personal computers).
Utilize Libraries:
Libraries like transformers from Hugging Face are commonly used in Python to load and interact with these models. You'll load the tokenizer and the model itself.
Inference:
Once loaded, you can use the model for inference by providing input prompts and receiving generated responses. This involves tokenizing your input, passing it to the model, and then decoding the model's output.
Example (conceptual):
Python

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the tokenizer and model (replace with the actual model path/name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-7B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-7B")

# Prepare your input prompt
prompt = "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."

# Tokenize the input
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate the response
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1)

# Decode the output
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(generated_text)
Key Advantages of Local Deployment:
Cost-Effective: No API costs or token-based charges.
Data Privacy: Your data remains on your local machine.
Customization: Greater control over the model's environment and usage.
While running larger models locally may require significant hardware, DeepSeek offers smaller, distilled versions optimized for personal use, allowing for direct Python integration and experimentation.

Ollama provides a convenient way to run free, open-source large language models (LLMs) locally and interact with them directly from Python. This is achieved through the official ollama Python library.
Steps to use Ollama models in Python:
Install Ollama:
Download and install the Ollama server for your operating system from the official Ollama website. This will set up the local environment to run the models.
Download a Model:
Use the Ollama command-line interface (CLI) to download the desired model. For example, to download Llama 3:
Code

    ollama run llama3
This command will download the model and launch an interactive chat session. You can exit the session by typing /bye.
Install the Ollama Python Library: Install the ollama Python package using pip:
Code

    pip install ollama
Interact with the Model in Python: You can now use the ollama library to interact with the downloaded model.
Example of basic interaction:
Python

    import ollama

    response = ollama.chat(model='llama3', messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': 'Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.',
        },
    ])
    print(response['message']['content'])
Example of streaming responses:
Python

    import ollama

    stream = ollama.chat(
        model='llama3',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Tell me a short story about a robot.'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk['message']['content'], end='', flush=True)
Key Points:
Ollama handles the complexities of running LLMs locally, including model weights, configuration, and GPU usage (if available).
